**Experienced developer in the Javascript world**. Since 2013, JS became my main technology!

I began like a **frontend** developer with a standalone manner. Convinced with this language, I changed my way to continue with Javascript and this time on the **backend** side: NodeJS. And today the story continues! It will be awesome to reach **an international company** and to help develop **a great solution**.

I like the idea that Javascript was a poor language at the beginning, just enough to do small stuff on client side. But today, it is an amazing way to make an application with high availability. I would like to believe that I will have the same story: Even if I haven't the education for, **I'm an autodidact and I have the dream of being a great software engineer!**
